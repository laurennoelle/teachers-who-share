# Teachers Who Share App
This is a web application designed for educators to share original educational materials or other educational resources they have found or created with each other. As a former teacher, the search for materials, activities and resources for my classroom was endless. This app is intended for teachers who have previously created great resources or discovered resources to share with other teachers that makes it easier to focus on what really matters and to save you precious time without having to reinvent the wheel. 

This captstone project was created by [Lauren Erxleben](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-erxleben) at Flatiron School.

## User Stories

* A user comes to the site looking for a particular resource to use with their students 

* A user can browse the catalog of resources by searching or filtering through the resources by grade level, subject or query and can navigate to its detail page

* A user can view the selected resource and save it to their profile to use at a later time

* A user can view their profile with all their saved resources and will be able to share a resource via social media.

* A user can submit a form to share a resource they have already created to the site

## Feature Stories:

* Landing Page: A user lands on the site and logs into their existing account or creates a new account. The user will have authentication while they are logged in and when navigating the site; without having to sign in multiple times.

* Search Filtering: A user will have a menu to filter their search based on the grade level they teach, the subject they are teaching, or by typing a query into the search bar that filters through the resources. The user can click on a resource to go to its detail page.

* Detail Page: A user can view all the criteria for the resource including title, ratings, previews of PDFs, grade level, subject and comments. The user will be able to save this resource to their profile page.

* User Profile: A user will navigate to their personal profile page that lists their saved resources. This makes a POST request to the backend to display the data. They will have the option to click on a "share" button to share the linked resources to other teachers via social media. 

* Resource Form: A user will be able to fill in a form to share an educational resource they have created to the site. This will make a POST request to the database and be shared publicly.

## Stretch Goals

* A user will have the option to "donate" any amount to the teacher who created the original resource.

* A user can file upload their PDF or material content to the site when using the "Share a resource" form

<!-- ## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
